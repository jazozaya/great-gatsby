If you're experiencing no ink or paste coming out of the print head during printing it may be due to one of a few key reasons:

## Incorrectly primed

When you rotate the dispenser gear clockwise, the plunger moves downwards. When priming, rotate the gear so that ink barely starts to come out, then **rotate it back Â¼ turn.**

Too much ink will be dispensed if you did not rotate back enough. Not enough ink will be dispensed if you rotated back too much.

<div class="warning info">
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you do not move the gear after printing, the next time you use the V-One the dispensers will already be primed and ready to go!.</p>
</div>

## Clogged nozzle

If you turn the dispenser gear clockwise and you feel resistance but ink is not coming out, then the nozzle is probably clogged.

Did you store them in the fridge? Ink must be stored in low temperatures when not in use. Leaving the ink at room temperature for a long time will cause the ink to dry and harden.

From time to time, nozzles may still clog even if ink was stored properly.

<div class="important info">
<p>Never try to clear a clog by brute force. The dispensing plunger will pierce the piston and <strong>you will destroy</strong> your ink cartridge.</p>
</div>

## Cartridge Seal Broken

If too much pressure is applied to a cartridge with a broken or clogged nozzle, the seal in the cartridge will break, causing ink to leak into the barrel. This will cause ink to slowly print less and less over time. To resolve this problem, you need to transfer the ink to a new cartridge - see [Filling an Empty Cartridge](/docs/filling-an-empty-cartridge/)

## Out of ink

Confirm you still have ink left in the syringe. Look at the viewing window in the sheath and ensure the white plunger is not pushed all the way down to the tip of the syringe. If you have run out of ink, visit our store to pick up a new cartridge

## Extrusion motor stalling

If the dispensing motor makes an unusual noise during printing and no ink comes out, the motor is stalling. The motor is trying to rotate the dispenser gear but there is too much resistance. This happens when you have run out of ink or the nozzle is clogged. Replace your ink cartridge, or see instructions for addressing clogged nozzles.
