## Desktop Application

Download the V-One software installer for your operating system. Open the file and install on your system.

- [macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), macOS 10.14 (Mojave)](http://voltera-styx.herokuapp.com/download/osx)

## Drivers

### Windows 7

Before you install the V-One software it is important to install the printer drivers. Most connection issues experienced are because the wrong drivers are being used. Remember to install the drivers with administrator privileges.

### Windows 8, 10

If you are using Windows 8 or 10, the drivers will automatically download and install when you connect the V-One. There is no need to install a separate driver.

### Mac OS

If you are using the latest MacOS, Appleâ€™s native drivers should automatically work with the V-One out of the box. There is no need to install a separate driver.
