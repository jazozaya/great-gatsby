We offer several types of substrate and templates. Incorporating their dimensions and features into your design will improve your V-One experience. Visit our store to view them all.

## EAGLE Library

We have developed a Library for EAGLE that contains parts for all of the templates and substrates in our store. Using it is easy, just drop in the template as you would any other part and away you go.
