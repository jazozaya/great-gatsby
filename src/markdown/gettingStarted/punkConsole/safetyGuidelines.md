The V-One Drill attachment is a precision tool for electronics prototyping, specifically intended as an add-on to extend the functionality of the Voltera V-One to allow drilling of holes in FR1 substrates.

As with any piece of precision equipment, the V-One and the accompanying materials and accessories should be handled with care. Please review the following documentation to ensure a safe work environment and maintain optimal machine performance.

The V-One is not only an excellent tool for the seasoned electrical engineer but it is also a great way to teach electronics. Never leave the V-One unattended while in use, and supervise young and inexperienced users to ensure safe operation.

The V-One Drill is for use as-is. Any modifications or improper use without explicit approval and direction from Voltera will void your warranty and can potentially damage the device and cause bodily harm.

In case of emergency or prior to performing any maintenance, please ensure power cable is disconnected from the Voltera V-One and V-One Drill Attachment.

## Spinning Motor

<div class="safety-table">
    <img class="right-space" src="/docs/gettingStarted/punkConsole/drillSafety/spinningMotor.svg">
    <p>The V-One Drill contains sharp parts that will spin at high speeds during operation. Always ensure that the V-One Drill is properly mounted on the V-One before powering it on. Never handle the V-One Drill when the motor is spinning, and wait for the motor to stop and the appropriate software prompt before handling the V-One Drill. Keep fingers away from moving parts at all times.

## Wear Eye Protection

<div class="safety-table">
    <img class="right-space" src="/docs/gettingStarted/punkConsole/drillSafety/eyeProtection.svg">
    <p>	Wear eye protection at all times when operating the V-One Drill. To protect the eyes from particles, debris, or other ejected matter.</p>
</div>

## Sharp Tools

<div class="safety-table">
    <img class="right-space" src="/docs/gettingStarted/punkConsole/drillSafety/sharpTools.svg">
    <p>	The drill bits included with the V-One Drill are sharp. When the drill bits are not in use, remove them from the V-One Drill, and store them in the provided case to prevent damage to the equipment and accidental injury.</p>
</div>

## Dust Hazard

<div class="safety-table">
    <img class="right-space" src="/docs/gettingStarted/punkConsole/drillSafety/dustHazard.svg">
    <p>Drilling certain materials may release particles or byproducts which are harmful when inhaled. To mitigate this risk, use only Voltera-supplied FR1 substrates, and use a dust extractor or dust mask when drilling.</p>
