The Voltera V-One is a robust machine, but should be properly maintained to ensure consistently high quality printing.

## Protect the nozzle!

The golden rule of good quality printing is to protect the dispenser nozzle. If the nozzle tip is bent, broken, covered in debris, or dented, the print quality will be drastically effected.

- Gently wipe the nozzle with a clean tissue to remove ink or particle build up.
- Always store the dispenser with the nozzle cap on. Take care when removing the cap.

## Protect the Probe!

The probe is essential to good quality circuit printing.

- Always cap the probe when it is not mounted.
- Be gentle with the tip of the probe. If the probe is damaged, contact us for assistance.
- Ensure that the metal contacts on the probe cap are clean. If necessary, clean the contacts with a cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol.

## Refrigerate the Ink

The conductive ink and solder paste must be **stored in a refrigerator** or a cool place between 4-10°C (40-50°F), with caps on, to preserve their shelf life. The probe can be stored at room temperature.

<p>Failing to refrigerate your inks will severely impact both the shelf life and print quality!</p>

If the inks were left out by accident:

- If the ink or solder paste is left out for more than a day, we recommend that you purge the fluid in the nozzle by manually turning the dispensing gear.
- If no ink or paste is coming out, the nozzle is clogged. **DO NOT** try to clear the clog by force - this can puncture the piston in the cartridge. You must replace the nozzle.

## Limit Switch Cleaning

Ensure that the limit switches do not have ink build-up. Ink on the switches can lead to improper height calibration, which will cause poor quality printing or, at worst, a broken nozzle!

If ink has built up on the limit switches use a cotton swab with some isopropyl alcohol to gently wipe off the ink.

## Cleaning off inks

Wet inks can generally be wiped off using a paper towel or tissue. If ink gets on your skin, wash thoroughly with soap and warm water. For safety information, refer to the [SDS](/docs/sds/).

Dried ink that has not been baked can be cleaned by applying a small amount of isopropyl alcohol and rubbing with a paper towel.

Inks that have been baked are much more difficult to remove. Apply acetone to the baked ink, and rub vigorously using a burnishing pad. Repeat until the baked ink has been removed.

## Heated Bed Maintenance

Make sure that the printing platform does not have wet ink on it before a curing or reflow step. This will bake the ink, making it very difficult or impossible to remove.

## Transporting the V-One

When moving the V-One, do so by lifting by the base with two hands. Avoid lifting the machine by the bridge. For long distance transportation or shipping, it is recommended to store the V-One upright in the original packaging to avoid any damage during travel.
