## Unpacking your V-One

Once you’ve opened the box, remove the layers of foam one by one. Place them aside for now, and remove the V-One from the box. Avoid picking the V-One up by the bridge. Instead, use two hands and lift it from the base.

##Assembly

The V-One comes with 2 identical dispensers for the 2 ink cartridges: conductive ink and solder paste. Now that you are familiar with the parts, you can start assembling the V-One dispensers.

<div class="important info">
    <p>Be sure the dispenser’s plunger is fully retracted before assembling. If the plunger is too far out it can push ink out during assembly.</p>
</div>

1. Remove the dispensing cap from the cartridge sheath. Remove the green lids from the conductive ink cartridge.
1. Insert conductive ink cartridge into the sheath with the ink level visible through the viewing window.
1. Twist the dispensing unit back into the cartridge sheath.
1. Carefully twist the nozzle onto the end of the cartridge.
1. The conductive ink cartridge is used in the video. The same procedure applies for assembling the solder paste dispenser.

## Software Installation

Download the V-One software installer for your operating system. Open the file and install on your system.

- [Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10](http://voltera-styx.herokuapp.com/download/win32) (64-bit only)
- [OSX 10.11 (El Capitan), MacOS 10.12 (Sierra), MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)](http://voltera-styx.herokuapp.com/download/osx)

**Note** - Windows 7 Users will require FTDI drivers, visit our [downloads](/docs/downloads/desktop-application-and-drivers/) page to learn more

## Setting Up Your V-One

### Find a spot for your V-One.

- A flat, level surface with minimum vibration is optimal.
- A well ventilated area is recommended.
- Do not place the V-One on a surface that is susceptible to heat damage.
- Avoid exposure to extreme temperatures – room temperature is ideal.

### Connect your V-One.

- Connect the USB cable to the V-One, then to your computer.
- Connect the power cable to the V-One, then to an outlet.
- Open the Voltera V-One software.

<div class="warning info">
<p>The V-One may require a firmware update on startup. Do not disconnect or turn off the V-One during the firmware update!</p>
