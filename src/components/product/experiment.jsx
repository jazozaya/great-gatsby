            <h2>Use your own inks.</h2>
            <p>The Voltera V-One uses standard 5cc syringes. This means cartridges can be filled with any material you want to dispense with. We even offer UV blocking cartridges for sensitive inks!</p>
            <p>Our robust dispensing system can handle most high viscosity fluids right out of the box. Contact us today to find how we can help you!</p>

// - Refillable Cartridges (UV Blocking) (cartridge switching)
// - Finer Printing (150 microns)
// - Heated bed, not just for reflow.
// - Custom Substrates (and substrates with pre-defined features)


// - Need to get another quote, maybe use the one from Nina ???
// - Logo's of universities that have used the V-One.
//// Harvard, MIT, Oxford University, Stanford.

// Mini case study about how a researcher is using it.
//// Profile pic, area of research

// - Picture of multiple inks on multiple substrates.
// - Mention that we can print on flexible ink
