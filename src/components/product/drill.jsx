              Reduce the number of machines and interfaces in your workflow. The V-One Drill attachment brings CNC drilling to the V-One
              platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              The V-One's unique magnetic attachments makes tool changing a breeze. Use the drilling attachment to make quickly vias and
              through holes in your double sided boards.

              It was designed to be as compact as possible, but don't let its small size fool you - the V-One Drill can spin at 13,000 RPM
              with a runout of 3 mil (~75 microns).

                Copper rivets make an electrical connection between top and bottom layers and eliminates single layer design limitations.
                Rivets also provide strong mechanical connections for headers and connectors.
