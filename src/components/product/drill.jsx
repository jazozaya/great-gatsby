              Reduce the number of machines and interfaces in your workflow. The V-One Drill attachment brings CNC drilling to the V-One
              platform.

              The V-One's unique magnetic attachments makes tool changing a breeze. Use the drilling attachment to make quickly vias and
              through holes in your double sided boards.

            <p>
              It was designed to be as compact as possible, but don't let its small size fool you - the V-One Drill can spin at 13,000 RPM
              with a runout of 3 mil (~75 microns).

                Copper rivets make an electrical connection between top and bottom layers and eliminates single layer design limitations.
                Rivets also provide strong mechanical connections for headers and connectors.
