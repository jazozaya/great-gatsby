This is a very professional award so I suppose it is time for some serious and grown-up happy dancing.</p><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/f5727a2483d4a0cf2d693d63a8526d80/href\">https://medium.com/media/f5727a2483d4a0cf2d693d63a8526d80/href</a><p>Now, we're the kind of people who measure our success by the number of happy customers and cool technological breakthroughs we generate so I should explain why this is a big deal to us.</p><p>These days most startups' \"growth-at-all-costs\" mentality tends to result in unhappy employees, forgotten users, and ignored profits/unit economics. Don't get me wrong, we're <em>far</em><strong> </strong>from perfect in these areas and there is a time and place for focusing on accelerated growth. But the reason we're so stoked to receive this prestigious growth award is because we've worked so hard to make ours sustainable.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/313/1*S0BxiI2xtoraia23Ztee4A.png\" /></figure><p>We've been dedicated to working with fantastic local manufacturing partners, finding phenomenal global resellers, and building a team that truly believes in our vision of allowing product developers to <em>Build Hardware Faster</em>.</p><p>And that last point cannot be overstated. This company's success comes from the people inside it. I'm blessed everyday to work with passionate and caring people. People who put others first. People who are motivated by building amazing technology. People I call friends.</p><p>That is why this recognition means a lot. It is external appreciation of all the hard work and love that every Volteran has put into this company. Appreciation for the fact that we are punching way above our weight class in terms of the ratio of accomplishments/growth to headcount.</p><p>Our team has already almost doubled in 2018 and we will probably be growing by the same amount by this time next year. I don't want to be one of those people that ends their posts with a reminder that we're hiring across the board and that you should apply (work@voltera.io)... but I suppose I just did!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*4Zb5PimFV9Bz21U5.gif\" /><figcaption><a href=\"http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/yes/zack_gal.gif\">http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/yes/zack_gal.gif</a></figcaption></figure><p>-Alroy Almeida, <em>Co-founder/CEO</em> @ <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/14e37102160b\">Voltera</a></p><p><strong>About the Startup 50</strong></p><p>Ranking Canada's Top New Growth Companies by two-year revenue growth, the Startup 50 profiles the fastest-growing startups in the country.
