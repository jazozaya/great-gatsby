However, we were never content with our two-layer workflow, in fact, you weren't happy either.</p><p>Since automatic drilling of through-holes and vias was our most requested feature, we decided to tackle this big project last year.</p><p>We had a few guiding principles:</p><ul><li>It had to be an attachment to the V-One, not a standalone product</li><li>It needed to be ship-ready at launch (designed, certified, assembled, packaged, and beside the door ready to go out)</li><li>The workflow had to live within our existing software and be as simple as our printing, soldering, and reflow workflows</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a46e19_WCPOp_L51e5CtUg.png\" /></figure><p>Before we jump into what it can do, a few thank yous are in order. We are so grateful to our beta users <a href=\"https://community.voltera.io/u/emcniece/summary\">emcniece</a>, <a href=\"https://community.voltera.io/u/pyrophreek/summary\">Pyrophreek</a>, <a href=\"https://community.voltera.io/u/dhallmm/summary\">DhallMM</a>, <a href=\"https://community.voltera.io/u/lkl_butte/summary\">lkl_butte</a>, <a href=\"https://community.voltera.io/u/cborn/summary\">cborn</a>, and <a href=\"https://community.voltera.io/u/hbouzas/summary\">hbouzas</a> for their meticulous feedback and constant excitement. You made working on this project so fulfilling!</p><h4><em>The old way</em></h4><p>In the past our users would need to drill the holes manually on a drill press or Dremel press. This was especially difficult for headers or any other component that required precise spacing between holes.</p><p>Once the holes were drilled, they would have to be filled with ink by hand. This was... finicky.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/430/0*3UZB_nkxwXdtsY8r.gif\" /></figure><h4>The new way</h4><ol><li>As usual, mount your board on the V-One and upload the Gerber files (including the Excellon .txt hole file).</li><li>The software will guide you through drilling the holes and printing the top and bottom layers of the circuit</li><li>Insert PCB rivets into vias to create the electrical connection</li><li>As usual, dispense solder paste, add components, and reflow the board</li></ol><h4><strong>Does it work?</strong></h4><p>Yeah, we know... the drill is so small and cute (yes, you can describe lab equipment as cute!). That doesn't mean it lacks power or precision.</p><p>It runs a custom 13,000 RPM, externally powered motor that is surprisingly quiet and it only has 0.076mm (0.003&quot;) of runout.</p><h4>What's in the box?</h4><ul><li>Drill attachment and power cables</li><li>Drill bits: 0.70mm, 0.80mm, 0.90mm, 1.00mm, 1.60mm (2 of each)</li><li>Safety goggles</li><li>Sacrificial layer (to prevent drilling into the heated bed)</li><li>FR1 substrates: 2&quot; x 3&quot; and 3&quot; x 4&quot; (pack of 10 and 6 respectively)</li><li>Rivets: 0.4mm and 1.0mm inner diameters (approximately 200 of each)</li><li>Rivet tools: 0.4mm and 1.0mm (1 of each)</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e73f_awkWI4jYe6Op6k61Q.png\" /></figure><p>Want to find out more? We've <a href=\"https://www.voltera.io/product/drill/\">updated our site with pictures and videos</a> of the drill in action and it goes live in our store next week. <strong>Our introductory price will only last until March 31, 2018.</strong></p><p>For something so physically small, this was actually a very challenging product to design. In our next post we'll walk through the design process, new manufacturing techniques we used, and lessons learned.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=71d4dfcfba77\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">",
