        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>Our refund policy lasts 30 days from the date of delivery of your order. If 30 days have gone by since your date of delivery, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund.</p>
        <p>To be eligible for a return you must contact sales@voltera.io and request a Return Materials Authorization (RMA). Voltera reserves the right to refuse or return any product sent back without an RMA.</p>
        <p>Your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.</p>
        <p>To complete your return we require a copy of your purchase invoice.</p>
        <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.</p>
        <p>If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days dependent on the payment processor. If you receive a refund the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.</p>
