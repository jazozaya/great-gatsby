If you are in North America you can expect an email from Kelly to arrange shipping by the end of the week. Once we have confirmed shipping details with you we expect to start shipping units by the end of July! <strong>Printers will be shipped on a 'first come, first served' basis</strong>, based on when your shipping payment comes in.</p><p>International shipping will follow shortly after North American shipping.</p><p><strong>Software release </strong><br>As you've heard in past updates, Jesus and Troy have been hard at work rewriting the V-One's software to eliminate bugs found by batch 1 backers. Alpha-state software is ready for 64-bit Windows and OSX. By 'alpha' state we mean that it is stable and able to perform all of our core features, but a few more advanced features are still under development. The alpha release is able to print 1-sided boards, dispense solder paste, and reflow.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*b0EAFuDZIql4GjHxqvGw4A.jpeg\" /><figcaption><em>Here's a sneak peek of the software -- this is the printing stage.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The software team is working on additional features as we speak, but we would like to know what order to prioritize working in. So, we would appreciate it if you would <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JXKCXVD\">fill out a quick survey </a>to rank features based on their order of importance to you.</p><p>We can't wait to get these printers to you!</p><p>- The Voltera Team</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3a1d8db1cc3a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">",
