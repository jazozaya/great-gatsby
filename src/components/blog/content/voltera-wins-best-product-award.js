It brings together the leading companies in Printed Electronics (PE), Additive Manufacturing (AM), Wearables, Sensors, and other innovative tech industries.</p><p><em>It is a big deal because...</em></p><p>with hundreds of companies under the same roof, good things happen. Not only were we able to find many people who desperately needed a tool for rapid prototyping, but we were also able start relationships with companies that will allow us to expand the capabilities of the inks and substrates we offer. We've been excited about this for a while!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9KwFc75I7KnPe3sS.\" /><figcaption>Oh did we mention we're shipping?! ;)</figcaption></figure><p><em>It is a big deal because...</em></p><p>you get an opportunity to be a thought leader for your peers.
