Those of you who are earlybird batch 2 backers will have already received an email from Kelly regarding shipping confirmation. We can't wait to get these printers in your hands!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/638/1*UaTdcUZcep1AIj1gyFDFiA.jpeg\" /><figcaption><em>Printers in line for a few finishing touches</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Software Update</strong><br>As you know our software team has been rewriting the software that powers the V-One in order to fix many bugs that were found the first time around. Well, in the process of rewriting, they have managed to significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to dispense solder paste! In our test case it normally took 45 minutes to dispense solder paste onto a fairly complex 4&quot; x 5&quot; pre-fabricated board -- and the time to dispense onto the same board has been reduced to 15 minutes! The new software is already killing it.</p><p><strong>An inside look at clamps</strong><br>In case you've ever wondered \"what goes into making a clamp?\" (we definitely have), here are before and after pictures of the board clamps that are included with the V-One:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*3er2q5oAGhuS6zQmuLq_nw.jpeg\" /><figcaption><em>Metal stock, ready to be formed</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*dxuwQ8AlSxlTzl0_qDd2pA.jpeg\" /><figcaption><em>Freshly CNC'd clamps, ready for finishing!</em></figcaption></figure><p>That's all we have this week.
