We expected redoing these two tasks to take the better part of two weeks -- but Troy and Jesus managed to hammer them out in 2.5 days! The Mac installer is scheduled for completion this week. The new software architecture is already making our lives so much easier!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*9SCVtZrrZUUcImYlEewoNw.png\" /><figcaption><em>It lives!</em></figcaption></figure><p>We used to have separate probing sequences for printing and solder paste dispensing because the latter had to take into account things like pre-existing pads and holes. The team tried unifying them under one algorithm but certain missing edge cases and rounding errors made some points fall outside the mesh we use to map the surface. This resulted in the printer sporadically crashing the nozzle into the board! It took a while to find the root cause but once we figured it out we patched the problem right away.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*bK1jicMnj3PINMQ8E6OOgw.jpeg\" /><figcaption><em>Nozzle graveyard</em></figcaption></figure><p>The difficulty we experienced in diagnosing the previous bug caused the team to make big updates to the logs that are created during the print process. This will be a huge help when it comes to troubleshooting.</p><p><strong>We're all done in China</strong><br>The last of the batch 3 parts have been ordered, packaged, and shipped out of Shenzhen! This includes the linear rails, several kinds of shafts, bearings, and injection molded plastic. Kat is finally back home after meticulously handling all the Chinese parts since February!</p><p><strong>Our North American suppliers are knocking it out of the park</strong><br>The extruded aluminium from China we complained about for months would get graded A/B/C/D/F by us when we inspected them. Anything that was an F either got scrapped or turned into an internal testing unit. There were A LOT of Fs with that supplier. Now that we have moved extrusion back to North America we're seeing almost all A's!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*sTUjqbFPkX0ulEqJa8jyQw.jpeg\" /><figcaption><em>New bridges, ready to be installed!</em></figcaption></figure><p>The orders for all sheet metal, extrusion, and heaters have been placed and will be delivered to us in batches over the next several weeks. Many units are already in various stages of assembly based on the parts we've already received, and now the real fun is going to begin!</p><p><strong>Our business development team has also been hard at work</strong><br>We launched a <a href=\"https://voltera.io/?utm_source=kickstarter&amp;utm_medium=1606-2&amp;utm_campaign=June\">new website</a> to replace the old landing page. It really shouldn't have taken this long! There are a few features still in the works (like forums, and a web store), and more content is in the works, but take a look and let us know what you think! Email<a href=\"http://kickstarter@voltera.io/\">kickstarter@voltera.io</a> with any bugs or ideas you have!</p><p>Kelly is at the Canadian Engineering Education Association conference this week. One of the great things about the V-One is that it really does reduce the barriers to designing electronics and we're now looking to learn how we can put the V-One to good use helping teach the developers of tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Lastly, we're also making sure to spend some time on ourselves and causes we support</strong><br>Pat <a href=\"http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Toronto2016?px=3132636&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1561\">recently completed</a> a 210km ride to raise money for cancer research. He rides in this event every year, but this year he blew past his personal records. We're very proud of him!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*jiUV03YUoNTY-T_d2qk5Uw.png\" /><figcaption><em>Way to go Pat!</em></figcaption></figure><p>We also celebrated our 3rd birthday last week! We're so proud of what we have accomplished, and honoured to have backers like you supporting us.
